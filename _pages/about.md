I'm a multilingual, PhD-trained AI Scientist with over 6 years of hands-on experience building and deploying robust **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning** systems across industrial and scientific domains.

ðŸ’¡ I specialize in designing end-to-end AI pipelines â€” from data curation and model training to real-world deployment â€” with a focus on **image segmentation**, **object detection**, and **image enhancement**, using tools like **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, and different **cloud platforms**.

ðŸ§  In recent years, I've expanded into **3D vision**, working on **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)** and **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)** to push the boundaries of scene reconstruction and spatial learning.

ðŸŽ“ **By night**, Iâ€™m a dedicated tutor and mentor, delivering custom AI courses to learners from diverse backgrounds â€” from HPC engineers to startup investors â€” turning complex ideas into clear, practical skills.

ðŸš€ I bring a research-driven, engineering-oriented mindset â€” transforming cutting-edge AI into solutions that **scale, adapt, and deliver** with clarity and impact.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
